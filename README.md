# Customer-Activity-Dashboard
Using Splunk data and Power BI to visualize software platform customer use trends

This quick insight dashboard was created to display customer usage trends month over month and year over year. It includes a dropdown option to look at all customers in aggregate or to filter by a single customer. This dashboard was created to present insights to senior executives as well as provide a tool for account managers to easily monitor the adoption patterns among their customers. This ability has allowed account managers to identify those customer evangalists who may need more support building platform adoption in their oganizations. 

For example, Figure 1 displays a customer's usage trends in the form of total logins as well as unique logins. From the chart it apears that usage was higher in 2021 than 2022 but more variable. 2021 Peak usage occured in February and March but then declined into the summer with another more subtle peak immerging in the fall months.

The next visualization (Figure 2) shows the time users spent in the platform aggregated into units of days. We use this metric to investigate time spent in the platform to compliment the number of logins to monitor engagement through another lens. For example, users may log in many times but for short periods while others may log in less frequently but for longer periods. In both cases engagement is present but for potentially different use cases. Figure two displays the month over month and year over year data as the customer in Figure 1. It appears that while number of logins decreased month over month from 2021 to 2022 the amount of user time was pretty similar. This may have occured if expansion efforts in 2021 led to lots of logins but adoption efforts in 2022 were focused on getting users to spend more time in the platform. These insights helped account managers talk to customers about the nuances of their strategies allowing our team to better help expand or retain the accounts.
